# Code and Data for the Research Article on Cyanobacterial resource allocation strategies explained by Growth Balance Analysis

This repository contains **R** scripts for analyzing Growth Balance Analysis (GBA) models of *Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803* and generating publication-quality plots. The workflows cover:

- **Base model**
- **Extended model**
